# FRONTEND TICKETS

1. Title: 
     - Keep it Short and Descriptive.
        
        Example: Implement Employee Performance View Page in Angular


2. Description: 
     - Provide a Detailed Overview of the Task.

    - Purpose: Explain the need for the feature or change.

        - Example: "Develop a page to display employee performance metrics to managers, enabling them to assess employee productivity and achievements."

    - Scope: Specify what the ticket covers (and doesn’t cover, if applicable).
    
        - Example: "This ticket focuses on the frontend implementation in Angular. The backend API for performance metrics is handled separately."

3. Requirements
    - List Specific Requirements and Criteria.
    
    - Clearly define:
        - Functional Requirements: What the feature should do.
            - Example:

                - Display a list of employees with performance metrics such as tasks completed, hours worked, and goals achieved.

                - Include sorting and filtering options (e.g., by department, rating).

                - Provide a detailed performance view when an employee’s name is clicked.

        - Non-Functional Requirements: Performance or UI constraints.
            - Example:
                - Page should load performance data within 2 seconds for up to 1,000 employees.
                - UI must follow the company’s design system.

4. Tasks (Subtasks)
    - Break Down the Work into Smaller Steps.
        - Example:
            - Create a new Angular component for the performance view page.
            - Implement table UI to display performance data.
            - Add sorting and filtering functionality.
            - Create a modal or a separate page for detailed performance views.
            - Integrate with the API to fetch employee performance data.
            - Write unit tests for the performance view component.

5. Acceptance Criteria
    - Define When the Task Will Be Considered Complete.
        - Example:
            - The performance view page displays a sortable and filterable table of employees.
            - Clicking an employee’s name opens a detailed view of their performance.
            - API integration retrieves and displays performance data correctly.
            - All UI components adhere to the design guidelines.
            - Unit tests cover at least 80% of the performance view component.

6. Priority and Labels
    - Categorize the Ticket.
        - Priority: High, Medium, Low
        - Labels: frontend, angular, employee-performance

7. Attachments
    - Include Visuals or References.
        - Attach mockups, designs, or screenshots to guide implementation.

8. Dependencies
    - Mention Any Dependencies or Prerequisites.
        - Example: "This task depends on the backend API for employee performance metrics being available."
        - Link related tickets (e.g., API implementation, design mockup).

9. Testing
    - Specify Testing Requirements.
        - Unit Testing: Write test cases for the Angular component.
        - Integration Testing: Ensure the page integrates correctly with the API.
        - QA Checklist: Provide steps for the QA team to verify the feature.

10. Assignee and Sprint
    - Assign and Plan Appropriately.
        - Assign the ticket to the relevant developer.
        - Add it to the appropriate sprint or backlog.
